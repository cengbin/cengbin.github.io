Emphasis
--------

Emphasis, aka italics, with _asterisks_ or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or **underscores**.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. Scratch this.

Lists
-----

1.  First ordered list item
2.  Another item
    *   Unordered sub-list.
3.  Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
    1.  Ordered sub-list
4.  And another item.
    
    You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).
    
    To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅ Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅ (This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)
    

*   Unordered list can use asterisks
*   Or minuses
*   Or pluses

Links
-----

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com/)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com/ "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link](https://www.mozilla.org/)

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](file:///home/zhangjikai/%E4%B8%8B%E8%BD%BD/blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions](https://slashdot.org/)

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself](https://www.reddit.com/).

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. [http://www.example.com](http://www.example.com/) or [http://www.example.com](http://www.example.com/) and sometimes example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

Images

Here's our logo (hover to see the title text):

Code

    body{
        margin: 0 auto;
        font-family: Georgia, Palatino, serif;
        color: #444444;
        line-height: 1;
        padding: 30px;
    }
    

Tables

Colons can be used to align columns.

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell. The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Blockquotes
-----------

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text. This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can _put_ **Markdown** into a blockquote.

Inline HTML
-----------

Definition list

Is something people use sometimes.

Markdown in HTML

Does _not_ work **very** well. Use HTML _tags_.

Horizontal Rule
---------------

Three or more...

* * *

Hyphens

* * *

Asterisks

Underscores

MathJax
-------

Inline math equations go in like so: ω\=dϕ/dtω\=dϕ/dt. Display math should get its own line and be put in in double-dollarsigns:

I\=∫ρR2dVI\=∫ρR2dV

And note that you can backslash-escape any punctuation characters which you wish to be displayed literally, ex.: \`foo\`, \*bar\*, etc.
